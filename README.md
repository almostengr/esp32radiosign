# ESP 32 Radio Sign

## Purpose

A "tune to" sign is placed in the yard as part of the Christmas light show. I wrote this code 
so that the lights on the tune to sign change color. LED strip lights are connected to the ESP32, 
which acts as a controller for the lights. At random intervals, the ESP32 picks a color at random and 
switches the corresponding relays to display the color.

Since this is for a Christmas light show, only a few colors that are related to Christmas have been 
entered so that they can be selected.
